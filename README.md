# XAUUSD-Pullback-Strategy-Development-Analysis-
This project involved creating a "Simple Pullback Strategy" for trading Gold (XAUUSD), backtesting it using TradingView's Pine Script, and then performing a detailed analysis of the results using Python.
Okay, here's a summary of the Gold trading strategy building and backtest analysis project.

Strategy & Backtesting
Strategy Logic: The core idea was a trend-following pullback strategy.

It likely used a long-term SMA (e.g., 200) to identify the overall trend.

Entries were triggered when the price was above the long SMA but pulled back below a short-term SMA (e.g., 10).

Exits occurred when the price moved back above the short-term SMA.

A percentage-based stop-loss was included for risk management.

Backtesting Platform: The strategy was coded in Pine Script and backtested directly on TradingView over the period from October 23, 2024, to October 24, 2025.

Data Export: The detailed list of trades generated by the TradingView Strategy Tester was exported to a gold_data.csv file.

Python Analysis üêç
The exported CSV data was then analyzed using a Jupyter Notebook with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Data Preparation: The CSV was loaded, the Date/Time column was converted to datetime objects, and the Type column was cleaned.

Key Metrics Calculated:

Total Net Profit: $2,874.54

Total Trades: 17,868

Win Rate: 72.66%

Profit Factor: 1.09 (Gross Profit / Gross Loss)

Payoff Ratio: 0.41 (Average Win / Average Loss) - Indicates average losses were larger than average wins.

Expectancy (per trade): $0.16

Sharpe Ratio (Annualized): 3.85 (Based on daily returns, assuming 252 trading days)

Max Drawdown: 0.94% ($500.45)

CAGR: 5.75%

Calmar Ratio: 6.11 (CAGR / Max Drawdown %)

Average Trade Duration: ~8 minutes

Max Consecutive Wins/Losses: 29 / 8

Visualizations:

Equity Curve: Plotted the account equity growth over time, showing the peak equity and drawdown periods.

P&L Distribution: A histogram showing that most trades resulted in small profits or losses, with a higher frequency of winning trades.

Monthly P&L: A bar chart visualizing profitability month by month.

Conclusion
The backtest showed the strategy was profitable over the period analyzed, albeit modestly (Total Net Profit of $2,874.54 on an initial $50,000 capital). It had a high win rate (72.66%) but a low payoff ratio (0.41), meaning the average losing trade was significantly larger than the average winning trade. The maximum drawdown was very low (0.94%), resulting in favorable risk metrics like the Calmar Ratio (6.11) and a good Annualized Sharpe Ratio (3.85). The extremely short average trade duration suggests this was a high-frequency scalping approach within the defined period.
